# Project Information

## Project Conventions

### Pull Request Guidelines
- Never add Co-authored-by tags to PR descriptions or commits
- Use PR template from `.github/pull_request_template.md` if it exists
- Keep PR titles concise and descriptive e.g. "[{PREFIX}-{ISSUE_NO}] {TYPE}({SUBJECT}): {DESCRIPTION}" - example: [GMF-001] feat(components): form field
- Link related issues with "Closes #123" syntax
- Focus PR description on what changed and why, not who contributed

### Git Conventions
- Use conventional commit format: `feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`, etc.
- Keep commits atomic and focused

# Personal Preferences

## Communication Style
- When reporting plans to me, be extremely concise. Sacrifice grammar for the sake of concision.
- Always use British English instead of American English (e.g., "colour" not "color", "organised" not "organized").
